# Financial Econometrics (FTSE 100) — Stylized Facts & Time-Series Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Python-based Financial Econometrics notebook** focused on the empirical analysis of **FTSE 100 daily returns**.  
It reproduces key **stylized facts of financial return series** and applies standard econometric tools to study **stationarity, autocorrelation, distributional properties, and volatility clustering**.

The goal is to provide a **structured and reproducible workflow** that combines **data preprocessing**, **statistical testing**, and **visual diagnostics** in a clear academic format.

---

## Key Topics Covered
- Data collection and preprocessing of **FTSE 100 prices**
- Computation of **log-returns**
- Stylized facts of financial returns:
  - **Stationarity** of returns (**ADF / KPSS tests**)
  - **Autocorrelation** checks (**ACF + Ljung–Box**)
  - **Non-normality** (**skewness, kurtosis, Jarque–Bera test**)
  - **Volatility clustering** (**squared returns & ARCH effects**)
- Clear plots and interpretation-oriented outputs

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (**NumPy**, **pandas**)
- **matplotlib / seaborn**
- **statsmodels** (**ADF**, **KPSS**, **ACF**, **Ljung–Box**)
- **scipy** (statistical tests)

---

## Purpose
This notebook was written as part of a **Financial Econometrics mid-term assignment**, and can also serve as a reference template for:
- Return series analysis
- Stylized facts replication
- Time-series diagnostics in Python

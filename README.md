# Quant-Finance-Journey

Public learning log of my path into **quant finance & trading**.  
Projects are reproducible (Jupyter), documented, and versioned.

## Structure
- `projects/` – polished mini-projects (each has its own README + figures)
- `notebooks/` – exploratory notebooks by topic
- `src/` – small reusable helpers (data, metrics, plotting)
- `data/` – local cache (not in git)
- `reports/` – exported charts/tables to share
- `docs/` – images and write-ups

## Quickstart (later)
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Quant-Finance-Journey
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```
